Welcome! Iâ€™m Xiang Zhang, a PhD Candidate in the [Graphics and Image Computing (GAIC) Laboratory](https://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~lijun/Research/IGC.html) at Binghamton University, advised by [DR.Lijun Yin](https://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~lijun/). Before I joined Binghamton University, I worked in JD.com, Beijing, China, as an iOS developer. Before that, I graduated with a B.Eng. in Electronic Science and Technology from Nanchang Hangkong University, China. 

My research interests lie in the intersection of Computer Vision and Deep Learning. Specifically, I am passionate about exploring multi-modal learning for human facial analysis, affective computing, and their applications in various domains such as healthcare, security, and entertainment. I am seeking a challenging role to utilize my skills, education, and experience to make a meaningful contribution to the field.
